# Text Highlighting System for Swedish Text Analysis

## Objective
Develop a software application in Python that takes Swedish text and highlights key sections. This project is designed to assess your coding and problem-solving skills, with a focus on object-oriented programming and interface usability.

## Key Requirements
1. **Text Highlighting Functionality:** The application should accept Swedish text input and return the same text with important parts highlighted based on semantic analysis.
2. **Technological Implementation:** Utilize techniques like semantic analysis, large language models (LLMs), embeddings, regular expressions (regex), etc. The primary programming language should be Python.
3. **Object-Oriented Design:** Implement the solution using sound object-oriented design principles. The code should be modular, extensible, and maintainable.
4. **User Interface:** Develop a simple yet effective user interface for text input and display of highlighted text. The interface can be a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or a web-based interface.

## Deliverables
- A working version of the text highlighting application.
- Source code on GitHub with clear documentation and a ready-to-use README.
- Preparedness to discuss your implementation, design choices, and any potential improvements.

## Optional Enhancements (Time-Permitting and Completely Optional)
- **Customizable Highlighting Criteria:** Allow users to define or adjust their own rules for what parts of the text should be highlighted.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implement methods to enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of the application.
- **Your Own Ideas:** You are encouraged to add personal enhancements that showcase unique skills and innovative thinking. These are completely optional.

*Note: Enhancements, including any of your own, are optional and intended for those who wish to explore further. Your project is complete without them.*
